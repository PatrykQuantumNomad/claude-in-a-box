# RemoteKube

> An open-source AI-powered DevOps agent running inside your Kubernetes cluster, accessible from your phone via Claude Code's Remote Control.

RemoteKube (also known as claude-in-a-box) deploys Claude Code as a pod inside a Kubernetes cluster with full access to kubectl, Helm, and 30+ DevOps tools. It enables engineers to manage, debug, and monitor their clusters remotely from any device — including mobile phones via Claude's Remote Control feature.

## Key Facts

- **Type:** Open-source DevOps tool (MIT License)
- **Repository:** https://github.com/PatrykQuantumNomad/claude-in-a-box
- **Website:** https://remotekube.patrykgolabek.dev
- **Author:** Patryk Golabek (https://patrykgolabek.dev)
- **Category:** Kubernetes management, AI-assisted DevOps, remote cluster access

## Core Capabilities

- **Remote Control:** Manage your cluster from your phone or claude.ai. Start a session, run diagnostics, and resolve incidents without opening a laptop.
- **MCP Kubernetes Integration:** In-cluster read-only access to 14 Kubernetes resource types via kubernetes-mcp-server. Query pods, deployments, services, and more.
- **Three Startup Modes:** Interactive for hands-on work, remote-control for mobile access, or headless for automated scripted operations.
- **Tiered RBAC Security:** Choose readonly, operator, or airgapped security profiles. Fine-grained Kubernetes RBAC with NetworkPolicy isolation.
- **32+ DevOps Tools:** kubectl, helm, k9s, stern, trivy, grype, and 26 more tools pre-installed.
- **NetworkPolicy Isolation:** Egress-only networking with DNS, HTTPS, and Kubernetes API restrictions. No inbound ports exposed.

## Architecture

Phone/claude.ai → Anthropic API Relay → Claude Code (In-Cluster Pod) → MCP Server (K8s Sidecar) → K8s Cluster Resources

Infrastructure components: ServiceAccount, NetworkPolicy, PersistentVolume.

## Deployment Methods

1. **KIND (Local Development):** `git clone` → `cd claude-in-a-box` → `make bootstrap`
2. **Docker Compose (Standalone):** Set CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN → `docker compose up -d`
3. **Helm (Production):** `helm install claude-agent ./helm/claude-in-a-box`

## Use Cases

- **Incident Response:** Check pod status, read logs, and diagnose issues from your phone during on-call.
- **Remote Debugging:** Exec into pods, inspect configs, and trace network issues from anywhere.
- **Cluster Monitoring:** Watch deployments, check resource health, and review events without VPN tunnels.
- **Automated Operations:** Use headless mode for scripted health checks, automated reporting, and routine maintenance.
