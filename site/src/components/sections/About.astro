      What is RemoteKube?
    </h2>

      <p>
        RemoteKube is an open-source tool that deploys Anthropic's Claude Code as a containerized AI agent inside your Kubernetes cluster. Once running, it gives you remote access to <strong class="text-text-primary">kubectl, Helm, and 32+ pre-installed DevOps tools</strong> through natural language — directly from your phone, tablet, or browser via Claude's Remote Connect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Built for <strong class="text-text-primary">SREs, DevOps engineers, and platform teams</strong>, RemoteKube eliminates the need to open a laptop, establish VPN tunnels, or manage SSH keys during incidents. Get paged at 2am, open Claude on your phone, and start diagnosing — check pod status, read logs, inspect configs, and resolve issues in minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        It deploys on any conformant Kubernetes distribution — <strong class="text-text-primary">Amazon EKS, Google GKE, Azure AKS, k3s, KIND, and more</strong>. Choose from three RBAC security tiers (readonly, operator, airgapped) and three startup modes (interactive, remote-control, headless) to match your security posture and workflow. NetworkPolicy isolation ensures egress-only networking with no inbound ports exposed.
