# Project Research Summary

**Project:** Claude In A Box -- Astro Landing Page
**Domain:** Static marketing landing page for an open-source Kubernetes DevOps tool
**Researched:** 2026-02-25
**Confidence:** HIGH

## Executive Summary

Claude In A Box is an open-source DevOps tool that runs containerized Claude Code inside a Kubernetes cluster, providing phone-first remote cluster access via Anthropic's relay infrastructure. The landing page at `remotekube.patrykgolabek.dev` is a single-page marketing site whose job is to communicate this value proposition and drive visitors to the GitHub repo. Research across 100+ developer tool landing pages confirms the dominant 2026 pattern: dark-themed, centered hero with a bold headline, feature bento grid, copy-paste quickstart, and a clean footer. This page should follow that pattern while leaning into the product's unique visual hook -- the phone-to-cluster data flow -- as the signature hero visual.

The recommended stack is Astro 5.17.x (stable, zero JS by default) with Tailwind CSS v4 via `@tailwindcss/vite` (not the deprecated `@astrojs/tailwind` integration), deployed to GitHub Pages via the official `withastro/action@v5`. The Astro project lives in a `site/` subdirectory, completely isolated from the existing Docker/Helm/Kubernetes tooling. A separate `deploy-site.yaml` workflow with path filtering ensures the existing CI pipeline is never triggered by site-only changes and vice versa. This isolation is non-negotiable -- mixing the two build systems creates maintenance debt and wasted CI minutes.

The most dangerous pitfalls are all concentrated in Phase 1 setup: custom domain configuration is uniquely fragile on GitHub Pages (the CNAME file in `site/public/` must be present in every deployment artifact or the domain resets), the Pages source must be manually switched to "GitHub Actions" before the first deploy, and the Astro `site` config must not include a `base` setting when using a custom domain. All eight critical pitfalls documented in research are preventable at setup time with correct configuration. None require architectural changes once the foundation is correct.

## Key Findings

### Recommended Stack

Astro 5.17.x is the right choice: it generates zero JavaScript by default (ideal for a content-only landing page), ships built-in image optimization via Sharp, and has the most mature GitHub Pages deployment story of any static site framework. Astro 6 is in beta as of Feb 2026 and should not be used -- it dropped Node 18/20 support and has breaking changes that are not worth absorbing for a landing page. Tailwind CSS v4 changes the integration model entirely: configure it via `@tailwindcss/vite` directly in Astro's Vite config and use CSS-first `@theme` blocks instead of `tailwind.config.js`. The old `@astrojs/tailwind` integration is deprecated and does not support v4. For animations, `motion` (vanilla JS, v12.34.x) is the correct choice -- it works in Astro `<script>` tags without React, stays under 5kb for the APIs needed (animate, inView, stagger), and is actively maintained.

**Core technologies:**
- Astro 5.17.x: static site generator -- zero JS output, Vite-based, excellent GitHub Pages support
- Tailwind CSS 4.2.x + `@tailwindcss/vite`: utility CSS -- v4 CSS-first config, no `tailwind.config.js` needed
- TypeScript (bundled): type safety -- use `"extends": "astro/tsconfigs/strict"` preset
- Sharp (bundled): image optimization -- auto-converts to WebP at build time, zero runtime cost
- motion 12.34.x: scroll animations -- vanilla JS, no React dependency, lazy-loadable
- `@astrojs/sitemap` 3.7.x: SEO sitemap -- required for public-facing page, needs `site` set in config
- `astro-icon` 1.1.5 + `@iconify-json/lucide`: icons -- server-rendered to static HTML, zero JS runtime
- `withastro/action@v5`: CI/CD -- official Astro GitHub Action, supports `path: ./site` for subdirectory projects

**What not to use:** `@astrojs/tailwind` (deprecated for v4), `@astrojs/react` for animations only (adds 45kb for no reason), Astro 6 beta, `tailwind.config.js` (v3 pattern), `@astrojs/image` (deprecated since Astro 3), Google Fonts via `<link>` tag (GDPR and render-blocking).

### Expected Features

Competitor analysis (Warp, Linear, Railway, Coolify, K9s, Lens, Charm) and the Evil Martians study of 100 dev tool pages establishes clear expectations for what this page needs.

**Must have (table stakes):**
- Hero section with bold centered headline, subheadline, and two CTAs (GitHub + Quickstart)
- Feature bento grid (5-6 cards, asymmetric layout) -- Remote Control gets the large card
- Architecture diagram -- the phone-to-cluster flow is the product's "aha moment" and must be visual
- Quickstart terminal code block -- copy-paste Helm commands; this is the primary conversion point
- Use cases section -- 3-4 concrete scenario cards
- Footer with GitHub, docs, license links
- Dark theme with electric cyan/blue accent
- Responsive layout
- GitHub stars badge

### Architecture Approach

Complete isolation. The Astro project lives entirely in `site/` at the repo root. Two separate workflow files handle the two separate concerns: `ci.yaml` and `deploy-site.yaml` with path filtering.

### Critical Pitfalls

All critical pitfalls are Phase 1 setup issues:
1. CNAME file deleted on every deployment -- solved with site/public/CNAME
2. GitHub Pages source not set to "GitHub Actions"
3. `base` config set when using custom domain
4. Deploy workflow triggers on all pushes -- solved with path filtering
5. Wrong DNS record type for subdomain
6. `withastro/action` `path` parameter missing
7. `id-token: write` permission missing from deploy workflow
8. No 404.astro page
