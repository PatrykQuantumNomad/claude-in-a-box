# Requirements: Claude In A Box

**Defined:** 2026-02-25
**Core Value:** Deploy once, control from anywhere -- an AI-powered DevOps agent running inside your cluster that you can access from your phone without losing context, environment access, or session state.

## v1 Requirements

Requirements for initial release. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Container Image

- [x] **IMG-01**: Multi-stage Dockerfile produces a deployment-ready image with Ubuntu 24.04 base under 2GB compressed — *Achieved 1.42GB*
- [x] **IMG-02**: Claude Code CLI installed via npm with pinned version and auto-updater disabled
- [x] **IMG-03**: Full debugging toolkit (30+ tools) installed as static binaries with pinned versions — *32+ tools verified*
- [x] **IMG-04**: Container runs as non-root user (UID 10000) with tini as PID 1
- [x] **IMG-05**: Tool verification script confirms all tools execute correctly as non-root
- [x] **IMG-06**: CI pipeline with container vulnerability scanning (Trivy) and SBOM generation

### Entrypoint & Lifecycle

- [x] **ENT-01**: Entrypoint supports three startup modes via CLAUDE_MODE env var (remote-control, interactive, headless)
- [x] **ENT-02**: Entrypoint uses exec to hand off PID 1 to Claude Code for correct SIGTERM handling
- [x] **ENT-03**: Authentication via CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN env var with fallback to interactive login
- [x] **ENT-04**: Liveness and readiness probes for Kubernetes pod lifecycle management — *healthcheck.sh (liveness) + readiness.sh (readiness)*
- [x] **ENT-05**: Auth failure detection with actionable error messages (not raw 401 JSON)

### Kubernetes Deployment

- [x] **K8S-01**: StatefulSet with single replica and stable pod identity (claude-agent-0)
- [x] **K8S-02**: ServiceAccount with read-only ClusterRole (get/list/watch on pods, services, deployments, events, nodes, namespaces, configmaps, ingresses, PVCs, jobs, cronjobs, statefulsets, daemonsets, replicasets) — *14 resources*
- [x] **K8S-03**: Egress-only NetworkPolicy allowing Anthropic API (TCP 443), K8s API server (TCP 6443), and DNS (UDP/TCP 53)
- [x] **K8S-04**: PersistentVolumeClaim for OAuth token and session persistence at ~/.claude/
- [x] **K8S-05**: Operator-tier ClusterRole (opt-in) adding delete on pods, create on pods/exec, update/patch on deployments and statefulsets
- [x] **K8S-06**: Helm chart with parameterized templates and security profile values files (values-readonly.yaml, values-operator.yaml, values-airgapped.yaml)

### Local Development

- [x] **DEV-01**: KIND cluster configuration with 1 control plane + 2 worker nodes
- [x] **DEV-02**: Idempotent bootstrap, teardown, and redeploy scripts for KIND cluster
- [x] **DEV-03**: Makefile wrapping build-load-deploy chain (make build, load, deploy, bootstrap, teardown, redeploy)
- [x] **DEV-04**: KIND integration test suite validating RBAC, networking, tool verification, persistence, and Remote Control connectivity — *35 BATS tests*
- [x] **DEV-05**: Docker Compose reference file for standalone non-Kubernetes deployments

### Intelligence Layer

- [x] **INT-01**: MCP server configuration (.mcp.json) pre-wired for kubernetes-mcp-server with read-only mode
- [x] **INT-02**: Curated DevOps skills library for pod diagnosis, log analysis, incident triage, and network debugging — *4 skills*

### Documentation

- [x] **DOC-01**: README.md with setup guide, architecture overview, and usage instructions — *487 lines, 3 deployment methods, Mermaid diagram*
- [x] **DOC-02**: CLAUDE.md project context file auto-populated with cluster environment at startup
