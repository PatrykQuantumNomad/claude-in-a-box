## Critical Gap: Stagger Animation Bug

**File:** `site/src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro`, line 69
**Severity:** User-facing visual defect — 10 cards (6 FeatureCards + 4 UseCaseCards) remain invisible

**Root cause:** The `motion` library's `inView` callback receives a DOM `Element` as its first argument. Line 60 correctly uses `(element)`. Line 69 incorrectly destructures `({ target })` — DOM Elements have no `.target` property, so `target` is `undefined` and `target.querySelectorAll(".reveal-card")` throws a TypeError at runtime.

**Fix:** Change line 69 from:
```js
inView(".reveal-stagger", ({ target }) => {
  const cards = target.querySelectorAll(".reveal-card");
```
to:
```js
inView(".reveal-stagger", (element) => {
  const cards = element.querySelectorAll(".reveal-card");
```

**Impact without fix:** Users with standard motion preferences see empty spaces where feature cards and use case cards should be. Users with `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` are unaffected (CSS fallback sets `opacity: 1`).

## Tech Debt

### Phase 10: Foundation & Infrastructure
- SITE-02/SITE-03 runtime verification pending — commits have been pushed since verification, likely resolved

### Phase 12: Polish & Deployment
- Bundle size criterion "under 50kb" is ambiguous (61.25 kB raw / 21.65 kB gzip)
- Social sharing preview needs manual validation with opengraph.xyz

## Recommendation

Fix the stagger animation bug (1-line change) before completing the milestone. This is a user-facing defect that makes 10 content cards invisible.
