## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 8 phases derived from 26 requirements at comprehensive depth
- Roadmap: Phase 5 (Integration Testing) and Phase 6 (Intelligence Layer) can run in parallel
- 01-01: UID 10000/GID 10000 per CONTEXT.md (overrides ROADMAP UID 1000 reference)
- 01-01: Separate RUN per tool download for Docker layer caching
- 01-01: Node.js via direct binary download from nodejs.org
- 01-01: Claude Code via npm with DISABLE_INSTALLATION_CHECKS=1 for deprecation warning suppression
- 01-01: No exact apt version pins -- Ubuntu 24.04 tag is the version pin

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research flag: Claude Code OAuth persistence in containers has known issues (anthropics/claude-code#22066, #12447, #21765). Validate `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` and `claude setup-token` behavior early in Phase 2.
- Research flag: MCP server selection (Red Hat Go vs Flux159 Node.js) needs hands-on evaluation in Phase 6.
- Research flag: Helm 4.x chart API has breaking changes from Helm 3. Verify compatibility in Phase 7.
