1. Check pod status:

   kubectl get pods -l app={{ include "claude-in-a-box.name" . }} -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

2. Wait for the pod to be ready:

   kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod/{{ include "claude-in-a-box.fullname" . }}-0 -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} --timeout=120s

3. Attach to the Claude session:

   kubectl attach -it {{ include "claude-in-a-box.fullname" . }}-0 -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

4. To enable operator-tier RBAC (mutation permissions), upgrade with:

   helm upgrade {{ .Release.Name }} ./helm/claude-in-a-box -f helm/claude-in-a-box/values-operator.yaml

{{- if .Values.operator.enabled }}

NOTE: Operator RBAC is ENABLED. The service account has mutation permissions
(pod delete, exec create, deployment/statefulset update/patch).
{{- end }}
