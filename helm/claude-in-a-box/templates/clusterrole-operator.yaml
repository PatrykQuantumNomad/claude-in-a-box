{{/*
Operator-tier RBAC ClusterRole (elevated debugging permissions).

Adds mutation permissions on top of the reader tier:
  - pods/delete: Force-delete stuck pods (e.g., StatefulSet OrderedReady deadlock)
  - pods/exec: Shell into containers for live debugging
  - deployments+statefulsets update/patch: Trigger rollout restarts, update env vars

Only created when operator.enabled is true (via values-operator.yaml). This is
intentionally separated from the reader role so the principle of least privilege
is maintained by default.
